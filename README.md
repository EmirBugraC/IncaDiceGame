# IncaDiceGame
The game is a dice game. The player and the computer roll 2 dice and scores are determined by writing the greatest number first from 1 to 6, including 1 and 6. According to the rules the highest score in the game is 21 which is called INCA. After INCA (21), the numbers that are formed by two same numbers called "Double" comes next. The double with the larger digits is a higher score than the smaller one. In order: {66,55,44,33,22,11}. Finally, the remaining numbers are scored from largest to smallest. In Order: {65,64...32,31} (Excluding the INCA (21) and Doubles of course). Both sides start with 5 lives. Player always starts to the game first. The next rounds starter is determined by the previous roundâ€™s loser. The side that starts to the round first always has 3 chances to roll the dice. But both sides do not have to use these 3 chances. If the side started to the round first has rolled the dice less than 3 times, the next side will have as many chances as the first side used. While the player decides his or her score, he or she uses the "R" Roll button to roll and the "S" Stop button to stop, the computer moves with the rules written for it. The first side to reach 0 health loses.
